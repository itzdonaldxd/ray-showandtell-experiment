// ===========================================================================

// onSet, onAppend and onChange are called on every single update made by all
// players in each game, so they can rapidly become quite expensive and have
// the potential to slow down the app. Use wisely.
//
// It is very useful to be able to react to each update a user makes. Try
// nontheless to limit the amount of computations and database saves (.set)
// done in these callbacks. You can also try to limit the amount of calls to
// set() and append() you make (avoid calling them on a continuous drag of a
// slider for example) and inside these callbacks use the `key` argument at the
// very beginning of the callback to filter out which keys your need to run
// logic against.
//
// If you are not using these callbacks, comment them out so the system does
// not call them for nothing.

// onSet is called when the experiment code call the .set() method
// on games, rounds, stages, players, playerRounds or playerStages.
